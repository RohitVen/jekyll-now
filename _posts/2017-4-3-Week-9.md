What did I do this past week?

This week we spent the majority of our time talking about regex. Regex is an extremely useful tool to define patterns of characters. This tool looks like it will be especially helpful in the last part of our project; building a search feature for our website. 

What's in my way?

Next week looks like it's going to be a tough week. I have a Physics exam the same day that our project is due. I also have a lab that day. I'm worried that I won't be much help to my teammates. However, I still plan to do as much as I can to assist them.

What will I do next week?

We've made decent progress in project. We've all been working together to get as much of the project done as efficiently as possible. I've mainly focused on the design of the website and data collection. As soon as my partners working on the database are done, we should be good to go.

Experience so far

The class has been going well and keeps me interested to learn more. Part three of the project looks like it's going to be very interesting. I can't wait to start it!

Tip-of-the-week

Data scraping is tough work. My team has been using BeautifulSoup to make it slightly easier. https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
