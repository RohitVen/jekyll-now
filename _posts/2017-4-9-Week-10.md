What did I do this past week?

My team and I put in a ton of work on our project, and I think that it looks very polished and well done for what we expected to complete. There are still a few rough edges to work on, but that will get buffed out in part 3. We also have quite a number of CSS ideas to implement in phase 3. I'm really looking forward to working on it again as soon as possible. In class we continued to talk about SQL and database manipulations.  

What's in my way?

As of now, not much. Just weekly homework and readings. I'm finally done with nearly eight straight weeks of exams and now I can breathe a little. However, I can't relax just yet. The semester is almost over but I still about three more weeks of classes. Then I'll have to work on my final exams. 

What will I do next week?

Hopefully the specs for phase 3 of the project will be released, then my team and I can start working on it as soon as possible. That is what I plan to do for the next week.

Experience so far

The SQL code that we have been working through seems fairly simple enough. It's almost like English. But the code shows the power of databases and how easy it can be to filter and find any sort of information that you are looking for. 

Tip-of-the-week

Eat your vegetables.
