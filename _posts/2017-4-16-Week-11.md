What did I do this past week?

This week we talked about the requirements for the third and final part of our website project. We also started to move away from SQL commands and started looking into refactoring code in a program. I feel that this will be a very interesting project that I can use to imporve my previous projects.

What's in my way?

Time management. It's getting to be the end of the semester and all the final projects and exams are starting to flood in. I'm still keeping my head about water, but I have to keep treading. Finishing this project will be a huge weight off my shoulders. That way I can concentrate on other classes.

What will I do next week?

My team and I will continue to work on our database website. Our personal project specs include creating a search "engine" to search through our database. We will also polish up our Character and Tournament Models, and then we should be good to go.

Experience so far

The class is still going well, no real qualms or shake-ups to worry about. I'm really glad that we get to have more extra credit by creating a lesson plan about an extension project!

Tip-of-the-week

Milk and computers don't mix. I managed to fry the circuits on several of the keys of my keyboard and have to order a replacement. Better yet, keep any liquid away from your electronics.
