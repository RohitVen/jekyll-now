What did I do this past week?

This was a fantastic week for me. It was probably the only time in the semester that I was actually on top of all my work. I managed to finish a good chunk of my weekly homework several days before it was due. This gave me an ample amount of time to pour into my group project. In terms of the class, we finished up refactoring and are looking to close the semester out.

What's in my way?

Not much now. There are only two more weeks left in the semester and then it's finals season. All that is left in this class is the second midterm in two weeks and the upcoming project presentations.

What will I do next week?

My team and I have been working on our slide deck for the group presentation. In addition to this, we have also been working on the extra credit presentation that will happen sometime on Tuesday in two weeks from now.

Experience so far

This semester has been a fun one. The projects in this class have been quite interesting despite not being too challenging. We got to implement a lot of ideas and workflows that I had learned during my internship in the summer (workflows being Agile, User stories, etc).

Tip-of-the-week

Study hard and don't slack off just yet. We still have two more weeks!
