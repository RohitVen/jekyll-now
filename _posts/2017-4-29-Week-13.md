What did I do this past week?

It's the second to last week on classes. This week we presented a lecture on extension tools for Python. My group presented on Python's IterTools. We also started to present our websites that we've been working on over the semester. My group will be presenting next week.

What's in my way?

Final midterms and then my finals. I have three midterms next week, so it's going to be a taxing week. After that I have two finals (both on the same day) on the very last day. After that, I'll finally be able to start my summer.

What will I do next week?

Studying. Lots and lots of studying. 

Experience so far

It's been a great semester. It has had its ups and downs, but I still feel like it was still successful. I'm looking forward to my next and final year here at UT.

Tip-of-the-week

Use the summer wisely, but have fun and relax!
