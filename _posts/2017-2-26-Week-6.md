What did I do this past week?

This past week I spent a majority of my time reading about our new project: A Netflix customer predictor. I also worked with my partner over the weekend on this project. We came up with a solution that utilizes the caches provided by Professor Fraij. We ran in to quite a few bugs that we really shouldn't have, but we're slowly making progress.

What's in my way?

Right now, my partner and I are having trouble coming up with an algorithm to calculate a customer's rating for a movie. The sources that Professor Fraij gave us a little vauge on the math. Hopefully we can get some help during office hours, or we'll be able to figure this out on our own. Other than that, I have a Physics exam the same day that the project is due, so I'm in a real crunch.

What will I do next week?

So far, the plan is to continue working on the Netflix project with my partner using pair programming, keep up with the reading in this and all my classes, and hopefully ace my Physics test.

Experience so far

Every week goes by very smoothly in this class. I came across a few concepts early on that I struggled to understand, but now everything is rather simple. It doesn't take a lot to understand these concepts when Professor Fraij teaches them, so hats off to him.

Tip-of-the-week

The CNS Career fair is coming up, so what better time to start brushing up on your interview skills (especially those pesky coding interviews). I've already got an internship lined up for the summer, but it's always a good idea to brush up on our data structures and algorithms. HackerRank is a great website for this. And you can always go the more traditional route and buy "Cracking the Coding Interview." Good luck to everyone at the career fair!
